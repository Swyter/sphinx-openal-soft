About this repository
=====================

[OpenAL Soft](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft) is a software implementation of the OpenAL 3D audio API. It is a free and open-source low-level framework that can be used to output music and environmental sounds in a virtual scene.

This is a forked version published to comply with the *GNU Lesser General Public License 2.0*, containing the code used for the Nintendo Switch™ version of *[Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy](https://thqnordic.com/games/sphinx-and-cursed-mummy)*, built as a dynamic library. 

The game's great audio mixing and spatialization under Windows, Linux, macOS and Nintendo Switch™ would not work without it. Chris Robinson has been credited, and his project, among others, are listed under the legal screen.

You can also download the code as a `.zip` file from [here](https://github.com/THQNordic/sphinx-openal-soft/releases/tag/releases).
